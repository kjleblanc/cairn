# Task 024 — Report

What changed:

- Created `app/src/renderer/screens/Chat.tsx` (169 lines, under the ~250-line
  budget). Loads `conductorStatus()` and the project's `stones` count on
  mount; while not connected, renders `ConnectCard`; once connected, resumes
  the newest conversation via `conductor:conversations` →
  `conductor:turns` (falls back to an empty conversation when none exist).
  Subscribes to `onConductorDelta`, filtered to this project's `dir`:
  `delta` events append to a ref-backed streaming buffer (a ref, not just
  state, so the error/stop handler can read the exact in-flight text
  synchronously rather than off a stale closure); `done` appends the
  server-persisted turn and clears streaming state; `error` (provider
  failure or a manual Stop — both delivered as `{kind:"error"}`) flushes any
  partial streamed text into a local `"...(stopped early)"` bubble — mirroring
  exactly what `service.ts`'s abort branch persists to disk — and shows a
  plain system bubble with the message and a "Try again" button that resends
  the last owner message. The composer is a `textarea`: Enter sends,
  Shift+Enter inserts a newline. `onOpenTask` is accepted per this task's
  prop contract but intentionally unused — no `cairn-task` block is parsed
  or rendered here (that is Task 025's job); the destructured param is
  renamed `_onOpenTask` with a comment explaining why.

- Created `app/src/renderer/components/ConnectCard.tsx` (91 lines). Base URL
  (defaults to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`), model, and password-type key
  fields; re-fetches `conductor:consentCard` whenever base URL or model
  changes (guarded client-side by `new URL(baseUrl)` so a malformed
  in-progress URL never round-trips to main); renders the exact `data`/`cost`
  strings from the response — never a renderer-side copy. The consent
  checkbox uses the brief's exact sentence. Connect stays disabled until the
  card has loaded, the checkbox is checked, and a key is typed; the key field
  is cleared after every connect attempt, success or failure, per the brief.

- Created `app/src/renderer/components/BodyPill.tsx` (71 lines). Shows
  `provider · model`; click opens a small panel with a model field, "Save"
  (`conductor:setModel`), "Disconnect" (`conductor:disconnect`), and a
  "Last reply: N tokens · $X.XXXX" line when the most recent Cairn turn
  carries `tokens`/`costUsd`.

- Modified `app/src/renderer/App.tsx`: added the `"chat"` view
  (`{ name: "chat"; dir: string }`), a `conductorEnabled` state set from
  `preflight.conductor` in `boot()`, and the `Chat` case wiring `onBack` to
  the same `openProject(view.dir)` pattern `"task"` already uses and
  `onOpenTask` to a plain navigation to `"task"` (no prefill yet — `TaskRun`
  doesn't accept one until Task 025 adds it, matching the plan's file list).

- Modified `app/src/renderer/screens/Dashboard.tsx`: added
  `conductorEnabled`/`onTalkWithCairn` props; the "Talk with Cairn" pill sits
  next to "Start a task" and renders only when the flag is on.

- Modified `app/src/renderer/components/Scene.tsx`: added an optional `fill`
  prop — when true, the `<svg>` gets `height="100%"` and
  `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice"` so it covers its container instead
  of the Dashboard's fixed-aspect strip. The Dashboard's own `<Scene
  stones={...} justAdded={...} />` call is untouched (no `fill`, so both
  new attributes stay `undefined` and the rendered markup is unchanged).

- Modified `app/src/renderer/app.css`: `.chat-screen` is
  `position: fixed; inset: 0` so it escapes `.shell`'s 860px max-width
  without touching `.shell` itself; `.chat-scene` holds the full-bleed
  `Scene`; `.chat-column` is the floating conversation surface
  (`--card-solid`, never a translucent `--card`, per the spec's "no
  translucency"); `.chat-column-static` lets the connect card (which has no
  natural flex-scroll region) size to its content instead of being cropped
  by the conversation layout's fixed height — added after the first manual
  smoke run showed the Connect button clipped by `overflow: hidden` (see
  Self-review below). `.bubble-owner`/`.bubble-cairn`/`.bubble-system`,
  `.chat-composer`, `.body-pill-wrap`/`.body-pill-panel`; a small-viewport
  rule in the existing `@media (max-width: 620px)` block. Also added
  `input[type="password"]` to the existing `textarea, input[type="text"]`
  selector — it had no styling before this task since no earlier screen used
  a password field.

- Modified `app/src/main/main.ts`: imports and calls `registerConductorIpc()`
  unconditionally alongside `registerProjectIpc()`, ahead of
  `createWindow()` — the channels are always live; only the renderer's route
  to them is flag-gated.

- Modified `app/src/main/ipc.ts`: `preflight()` now also returns
  `conductor: process.env.CAIRN_CONDUCTOR === "1"`, mirroring `CAIRN_MOCK`'s
  existing path to the renderer. Added the authorized extra channel
  `conductor:consentCard(baseUrl, model)`, returning
  `Result<ConductorConsentCard>` from `conductorService.conductorConsentCard`
  — wrapped in try/catch (an invalid base URL throws inside `new URL()`)
  but deliberately *not* routed through `logError`/`toResult`, since a
  malformed URL here is an expected mid-typing state, not a fault, matching
  the existing "expected decline, no log write" convention used by
  `conductor:connect`'s own gate. Updated the doc comment above
  `registerConductorIpc` (it previously said "not yet called anywhere").

- Modified `app/src/preload.ts`: exposed `conductorConsentCard`.

- Modified `app/src/shared/ipc.ts`: `Preflight` gained `conductor: boolean`;
  `CairnApi` gained `conductorConsentCard(baseUrl, model):
  Promise<Result<ConductorConsentCard>>`.

Checks run (all real, this session, in `app/`):
- `npm run typecheck` — clean, no errors.
- `npm run test:unit` — 37/37 pass (unchanged; no pure-module logic added).
- `npm run build:vite` — all three bundles built cleanly (main.js 64.45 kB,
  preload.js 1.60 kB, renderer index.js 177.07 kB).
- `npm run test:smoke` — 13/13 pass, including both `routing.spec.ts`
  tripwires against `App.tsx`/`shared/ipc.ts` (no forbidden legacy-surface
  words introduced; `taskRoute`/`taskRun` still present).

How to try it (visual check, no provider needed):
`$env:CAIRN_MOCK="1"; $env:CAIRN_CONDUCTOR="1"; npm.cmd --prefix app start`
— open a project, the Dashboard shows "Talk with Cairn" next to "Start a
task"; clicking it shows the full-bleed hillside with the floating connect
card (base URL prefilled, consent text refreshing as you edit the fields,
Connect disabled until the checkbox and a key are filled).

Beyond the brief's own instruction, this session also verified the
*connected* layout end-to-end against a throwaway local SSE server (not
committed — a scratch script + fake `node:http` server, deleted after use)
standing in for OpenRouter: real Connect through the UI (exercising the
actual `safeStorage`-encrypted `userData/conductor.json` round trip),
streaming deltas with the Stop button, the finished reply rendered through
`Md`, the BodyPill panel showing "418 tokens · $0.0003", conversation
persistence across a full app relaunch (the owner's prior message reappeared
on reopen), and Disconnect clearing `conductor.json` back to nothing —
confirmed by checking the real file on disk before and after. One run also
exercised the provider-error path for real: a stale connection pointing at
an already-closed fake server produced the exact plain-words system bubble
with "Try again", proving the error/flush-partial-text code path fires on a
genuine fetch failure, not just by inspection.

Limitations:
- Behavior coverage via the project's own Playwright suite arrives with
  Task 026's fake-body fixture and `conductor.spec.ts`, as the plan
  anticipates; this task is verified by typecheck, unit tests, build, the
  unchanged smoke suite, and the manual/scratch verification described
  above, all of which ran for real this session but none of which are
  checked into the repo's test suite yet.
- `onOpenTask` and the `taskBlock` field on `done` deltas are accepted but
  unused in this screen — no `TaskCard` exists until Task 025. A `done`
  delta carrying a valid `cairn-task` block currently just shows the
  stripped conversational text with no card; that block-parsing logic is
  already correct in `main` (Task 021/018), only the renderer's card is
  pending.
- `conductor:consentCard` is called on every base-URL/model keystroke (once
  the URL parses); this is unthrottled. It's a cheap synchronous main-side
  computation, so no debounce was added, but a very fast typist could fire a
  handful of redundant IPC round-trips.
- The connect card's `overflow-y: auto` scroll behavior (`.chat-column-static`)
  is not covered by an automated test; it was caught and fixed only via the
  manual screenshot smoke run in this session (see Self-review).

Self-review: the first manual screenshot pass caught a real layout bug —
`.chat-column`'s fixed height + `overflow: hidden` (designed for the
scrolling `.chat-messages` region in the connected view) silently clipped
the Connect button off the bottom of the not-yet-connected card. Fixed with
the `.chat-column-static` modifier (auto height, its own scroll, tighter
top margin) applied only when `!status?.connected`; re-screenshotted to
confirm the full card, including the Connect button, is now visible without
scrolling on the app's default 1100x760 window. Re-ran `typecheck`,
`build:vite`, and both scratch scripts after the fix. Verified
`git status --porcelain` at the repo root lists only the intended files
before staging, and that no scratch files (`scratch-smoke-chat*.mjs`,
`scratch-fake-server.mjs`) were left in `app/`.

## Review fixes

Code review returned two Important findings and two Minors; all four fixed
in this same task, no new repo task number, per the coordinator's
direction. Files touched: `app/src/renderer/screens/Chat.tsx`,
`app/src/renderer/App.tsx`, `app/src/renderer/app.css`,
`app/src/renderer/components/ConnectCard.tsx`.

- **Deltas were not conversation-scoped** (`Chat.tsx` only filtered incoming
  deltas by `dir`). Added `conversationIdRef` (a ref mirror of
  `conversationId` for synchronous reads inside the delta subscription) and
  `inFlightRef: { id: string | null } | null` tracking the send currently
  in flight — its `id` starts at whatever conversation it targeted
  (possibly `null` for a brand-new conversation) and is locked in the first
  time it's learned, from whichever arrives first: the `conductor:send`
  response or a delta that races ahead of it. The delta handler now ignores
  any event matching neither the displayed conversation nor the in-flight
  one, and never calls `setConversationId` from such an event.
  `newConversation()` is now `async` and, while `streaming`, `await`s
  `cairn.conductorStop(dir)` before clearing state, so main's per-dir lock
  is actually released before the screen looks empty. `send()`'s
  post-response id adoption is guarded the same way, so a stale response
  can't leak in either.

- **`.chat-screen`'s fixed full-bleed layer painted over `App.tsx`'s
  `ErrorCard`.** Kept `.chat-screen` fixed (preserves the spec's full-bleed
  layout) and instead gave the top-level error deterministic stacking: a
  new `.app-error-overlay` wrapper around `ErrorCard` in `App.tsx`, styled
  `position: fixed; z-index: 1000` in `app.css`. A positive z-index always
  paints after a fixed element left at z-index auto (what `.chat-screen`
  has), regardless of DOM order — no other screen's layout changed.

- **`ConnectCard.tsx`: key clear now runs in `finally`**, so the "cleared
  either way" promise holds even if the `conductorConnect` invoke itself
  rejects, not just when it resolves.

- **`ConnectCard.tsx`: Connect now also requires `model.trim()`** (button
  `disabled` expression and the `connect()` guard clause both updated) — an
  empty model no longer connects and defers the failure to the first send.

Verified with throwaway scratch Playwright scripts (not committed): a
message-content-distinguishing fake SSE server proved that clicking "New
conversation" mid-stream clears the screen immediately and that the
abandoned stream's reply (tagged distinctly from a fresh reply) never
appears, even after waiting out its full duration; a fresh send in the new
conversation succeeded immediately with no "already answering" refusal,
confirming `stop()` was awaited for real. A second script deleted the open
project's folder, clicked "← Project home" from the chat screen, and
confirmed (via `document.elementFromPoint` at the overlay's own center,
plus a screenshot) that the error text is the topmost element on screen
while `view` stays `"chat"`. A third confirmed Connect stays disabled with
an empty model field and enables once one is typed.

Re-ran `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:unit` (37/37), `npm run
build:vite`, and `npm run test:smoke` (13/13) after the fixes — all green.

Milestone movement: NO

Disposition: DONE
